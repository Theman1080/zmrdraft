    <p>As an important man once said, <blockquote cite="http://en.widipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh">"She's yo Ho no mo!"</blockquote>
    <p>That's when I said, <q>I came, I saw, and I did not want anything to do with these people,</q></p>
    <p>Then the club called,<q><acronym title="Having Anger Towards Everyone Reaching Success">HATERS</acronym></q> where they wanted to <dfn>Corndog</dfn> me.</p>
    <p>I then said to meet me at:<p>
    <address>
      <p><a href="mailto:homer@example.org">
        homer@example.org</a></p>
      <p>1677 North Desert Dawn Drive</p>
    </address>
    <p>The HATERS then said<q>We <del>want</del> <ins>need</ins> to make you go out of buisness.</q><p>
     <p> I looked around and said<q> How about this,<br   /> How about I give you this candy bar that<br   /> <s>was $1.25</s><br  /> But, now it is $0.25? I ate some of it.</q></p>
    <p>The HATERS told me that the only conditions they would buy the candy bar is if I followed their five demands, which are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Want ham sandwiches</li>
      <li>Play the song Jaja Ding Dong by <i>Fire Saga</i></li>
      <li>Watch the movie called <i>The Room</i> multiple times</li>
      <li>Put sand in my gas hole
      <ul>
         I don't know really why, but i Think it sounds more of a pun</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Lastly, want to lower the candy bar price to $0.20.</li>
    <p>I responded<q>No Way!! That movie is rated one of the worst movies ever according many. I can't waist my time watching that movie. I have a source for that. It's on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Room#:~:text=The%20Room%20was%20panned%20by,the%20worst%20films%20ever%20made." target="_blank">Wiki</a></q></p>
    <p><q>If you don't belive me <a href="mailto:pryce.seely@gmail.com" target="_blank">email me</a> and I can show you a peer reviewed essay to prove you wrong. Also that $.20 sounds kinda low.</q></p>
    <p>I then was worried about the requests. I don't know why they are so adamant about <i>The Room</i> it just seems like they actually like it, but why. It's awful. I have never seen it and never will. Then at the corner of my eye I noticed something very frightening. Here is the closest image I can show you that will describe what I am seeing. </p>
